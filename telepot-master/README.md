### Recent changes

**6.3 (2016-02-06)**

- Added `Answerer` class to better deal with inline queries
- Made `telepot.glance()` equivalent to `telepot.glance2()`. Developers are encouraged to use `telepot.glance()` from now on.
- Added `telepot.flance()`, a combination of `telepot.flavor()` and `telepot.glance()`.

**6.2 (2016-01-18)**

- Handle new field `chosen_inline_result` in Update object
- `telepot.flavor()` returns a new flavor `chosen_inline_result`
- Added `telepot.namedtuple.ChosenInlineResult` class

**6.1 (2016-01-13)**

- Changed normal message's flavor to `normal`

**6.0 (2016-01-13)**

- Moved all namedtuple-related stuff to a new module `telepot.namedtuple`. All calls to the function `telepot.namedtuple()` should be changed to `telepot.namedtuple.namedtuple()`
- Added a function `telepot.flavor()` to differentiate between a normal message and an inline query
- Added `flavor` parameter to `telepot.glance2()` to extract info according to message flavor
- `notifyOnMessage()` and `messageLoop()` can handle inline query as well as normal chat messages
- Added a few `per_XXX_id()` functions useful for spawning delegates for inline queries
- Added `UserHandler`
- `reply_markup` parameter can accept namedtuples `ReplyKeyboardMarkup`, `ReplyKeyboardHide`, `ForceReply` as values

<a id="basics"></a>
## The Basics

To use the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), you first have to [get a **bot account**](http://www.instructables.com/id/Set-up-Telegram-Bot-on-Raspberry-Pi/) by [chatting with the BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

BotFather will give you a **token**, something like `123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`. With the token in hand, you can start using telepot to access the bot account.

#### Test the account

```python
>>> import telepot
>>> bot = telepot.Bot('***** PUT YOUR TOKEN HERE *****')
>>> bot.getMe()
{u'username': u'YourBot', u'first_name': u'Your Bot', u'id': 123456789}
```

#### Receive messages

Bots cannot initiate conversations with users. You have to send it a message first. It gets the message by calling `getUpdates()`.

```python
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> response = bot.getUpdates()
>>> pprint(response)
[{u'message': {u'chat': {u'first_name': u'Nick',
                         u'id': 999999999,
                         u'last_name': u'Lee',
                         u'type': u'private'},
               u'date': 1444723969,
               u'from': {u'first_name': u'Nick',
                         u'id': 999999999,
                         u'last_name': u'Lee'},
               u'message_id': 4015,
               u'text': u'Hello'},
  u'update_id': 100000000}]
```

`999999999` is obviously a fake ID. `Nick` `Lee` is my real name, though.

The `chat` field indicates the source of the message. Its `type` can be `private`, `group`, or `channel` (whose meanings should be obvious, I hope). In the above example, `Nick` `Lee` just sent a `private` message to the bot.

I encourage you to experiment sending various types of messages (e.g. voice, photo, sticker, etc) to the bot, via different sources (e.g. private chat, group chat, channel), to see the varying structures of messages. Consult the [Bot API documentations](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-types) to learn what fields may be present under what circumstances. **Bot API's [object](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-types) translates directly to Python dict.** In the above example, `getUpdates()` just returns an array of `Update` objects represented as Python dicts.

Note the `update_id`. It is an ever-increasing number. Next time you should use `getUpdates(offset=100000001)` to avoid getting the same old messages over and over. Giving an `offset` essentially acknowledges to the server that you have received all `update_id`s lower than `offset`.

```python
>>> bot.getUpdates(offset=100000001)
[]
```

#### An easier way to receive messages

It is troublesome to keep checking messages and managing `offset`. Fortunately, telepot can take care of that for you, and notify you whenever new messages arrive.

```python
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> def handle_message(msg):
...     pprint(msg)
...
>>> bot.notifyOnMessage(handle_message)
```

After setting up this callback, sit back and monitor the arriving messages.

Below can be a skeleton for simple telepot programs:

```python
import sys
import time
import pprint
import telepot

def handle(msg):
    pprint.pprint(msg)
    # Do your stuff here ...


# Getting the token from command-line is better than embedding it in code,
# because tokens are supposed to be kept secret.
TOKEN = sys.argv[1]

bot = telepot.Bot(TOKEN)
bot.notifyOnMessage(handle)
print 'Listening ...'

# Keep the program running.
while 1:
    time.sleep(10)
```

#### Quickly `glance()` a message

When processing a message, a few pieces of information are so central that you almost always have to extract them. Use `glance()` to extract a tuple of *(content_type, chat_type, chat_id)* from a message.

*content_type* can be: `text`, `voice`, `sticker`, `photo`, `audio`, `document`, `video`, `contact`, `location`, `new_chat_participant`, `left_chat_participant`, `new_chat_title`, `new_chat_photo`, `delete_chat_photo`, or `group_chat_created`.

*chat_type* can be: `private`, `group`, or `channel`.

It is a good habit to always check the *content_type* before further processing. Do not assume every message is a `text`.

A better skeleton would look like:

```python
import sys
import time
import telepot

def handle(msg):
    content_type, chat_type, chat_id = telepot.glance(msg)
    print content_type, chat_type, chat_id

    # Do your stuff according to `content_type` ...

TOKEN = sys.argv[1]  # get token from command-line

bot = telepot.Bot(TOKEN)
bot.notifyOnMessage(handle)
print 'Listening ...'

# Keep the program running.
while 1:
    time.sleep(10)
```

#### Download files

For a `voice`, `sticker`, `photo`, `audio`, `document`, or `video` message, look for the `file_id` to download the file. For example, a `photo` may look like:

```python
{u'chat': {u'first_name': u'Nick', u'id': 999999999, u'type': u'private'},
 u'date': 1444727788,
 u'from': {u'first_name': u'Nick', u'id': 999999999},
 u'message_id': 4017,
 u'photo': [{u'file_id': u'JiLOABNODdbdP_q2vwXLtLxHFnUxNq2zszIABM4s1rQm6sTYG3QAAgI',
             u'file_size': 734,
             u'height': 67,
             u'width': 90},
            {u'file_id': u'JiLOABNODdbdP_q2vwXLtLxHFnUxNq2zszIABJDUyXzQs-kJGnQAAgI',
             u'file_size': 4568,
             u'height': 240,
             u'width': 320},
            {u'file_id': u'JiLOABNODdbdP_q2vwXLtLxHFnUxNq2zszIABHWm5IQnJk-EGXQAAgI',
             u'file_size': 20480,
             u'height': 600,
             u'width': 800},
            {u'file_id': u'JiLOABNODdbdP_q2vwXLtLxHFnUxNq2zszIABEn8PaFUzRhBGHQAAgI',
             u'file_size': 39463,
             u'height': 960,
             u'width': 1280}]}
```

It has a number of `file_id`s, with various file sizes. These are thumbnails of the same image. Download one of them by:

```python
>>> bot.downloadFile(u'JiLOABNODdbdP_q2vwXLtLxHFnUxNq2zszIABEn8PaFUzRhBGHQAAgI', 'save/to/path')
```

#### Send messages

Enough about receiving messages. Sooner or later, your bot will want to send *you* messages. You should have discovered your own user ID from above interactions. I will keeping using my fake ID of `999999999`. Remember to substitute your own (real) user ID.

```python
>>> bot.sendMessage(999999999, 'Good morning!')
```

After being added as an **administrator** to a channel, the bot can send messages to the channel:

```python
>>> bot.sendMessage('@channelusername', 'Hi, everybody!')
```

#### Send a custom keyboard

A custom keyboard presents custom buttons for users to tap. Check it out.

```python
>>> show_keyboard = {'keyboard': [['Yes','No'], ['Maybe','Maybe not']]}
>>> bot.sendMessage(999999999, 'This is a custom keyboard', reply_markup=show_keyboard)
```

#### Hide the custom keyboard

```python
>>> hide_keyboard = {'hide_keyboard': True}
>>> bot.sendMessage(999999999, 'I am hiding it', reply_markup=hide_keyboard)
```

#### Send files

```python
>>> f = open('zzzzzzzz.jpg', 'rb')  # some file on local disk
>>> response = bot.sendPhoto(999999999, f)
>>> pprint(response)
{u'chat': {u'first_name': u'Nick', u'id': 999999999, u'type': u'private'},
 u'date': 1444728667,
 u'from': {u'first_name': u'Your Bot',
           u'id': 123456789,
           u'username': u'YourBot'},
 u'message_id': 4022,
 u'photo': [{u'file_id': u'JiLOABNODdbdPyNZjwa-sKYQW6TBqrWfsztABO2NukbYlhLYlREBAAEC',
             u'file_size': 887,
             u'height': 29,
             u'width': 90},
            {u'file_id': u'JiLOABNODdbdPyNZjwa-sKYQW6TBqrWfsztABHKq66Hh0YDrlBEBAAEC',
             u'file_size': 9971,
             u'height': 102,
             u'width': 320},
            {u'file_id': u'JiLOABNODdbdPyNZjwa-sKYQW6TBqrWfsztABNBLmxkkiqKikxEBAAEC',
             u'file_size': 14218,
             u'height': 128,
             u'width': 400}]}
```

The server returns a number of `file_id`s, with various file sizes. These are thumbnails of the uploaded image. If you want to resend the same file, just give one of the `file_id`s.

```python
>>> bot.sendPhoto(999999999, u'JiLOABNODdbdPyNZjwa-sKYQW6TBqrWfsztABO2NukbYlhLYlREBAAEC')
```

Besides sending photos, you may also `sendAudio()`, `sendDocument()`, `sendSticker()`, `sendVideo()`, and `sendVoice()`.

<a id="inline-query"></a>
## Dealing with Inline Query

By default, a bot only receives messages through a private chat, a group, or a channel. These are what I call *normal messages*.

By sending a `/setinline` command to BotFather, you enable the bot to receive *[inline queries](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline)* as well. Inline query is a way for users to ask your bot questions, even if they have not opened a chat with your bot, nor in the same group with your bot.

If you don't understand or don't care about inline query, you may skip this section. All your bot receives will be normal messages. All remaining discussions still work for you. You can even safely ignore code blocks that deal with inline queries.

If you do care about inline query, the important thing to note is that your bot will now receive two **flavors** of messages: normal messages and inline queries. A normal message has the flavor `normal`; an inline query has the flavor `inline_query`.

#### Use `flavor()` to differentiate the flavor

```python
flavor = telepot.flavor(msg)

if flavor == 'normal':
    print 'Normal message'
elif flavor == 'inline_query':
    print 'Inline query'
```

#### You may `glance()` an inline query too

An inline query has this structure:

```python
{u'from': {u'first_name': u'Nick', u'id': 999999999},
 u'id': u'414251975480905552',
 u'offset': u'',
 u'query': u'abc'}
```

Supply the correct `flavor`, and `glance()` extracts some "headline" info about the inline query:

```python
query_id, from_id, query_string = telepot.glance(msg, flavor='inline_query')
```

#### Answer the query

The only way to respond to an inline query is to `answerInlineQuery()`. There are many types of answers you may give back:
- [InlineQueryResultArticle](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequeryresultarticle)
- [InlineQueryResultPhoto](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequeryresultphoto)
- [InlineQueryResultGif](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequeryresultgif)
- [InlineQueryResultMpeg4Gif](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequeryresultmpeg4gif)
- [InlineQueryResultVideo](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequeryresultvideo)

These objects include a variety of fields with various meanings, most of them optional. It is beyond the scope of this document to discuss the effects of those fields. Refer to the links above for details.

As is the custom in telepot, you may construct these results using dictionaries. An alternative is to use the namedtuple classes provided by `telepot.namedtuple` module.

```python
from telepot.namedtuple import InlineQueryResultArticle

articles = [{'type': 'article',
                'id': 'abc', 'title': 'ABC', 'message_text': 'Good morning'},
            InlineQueryResultArticle(
                id='xyz', title='ZZZZZ', message_text='Good night')]

bot.answerInlineQuery(query_id, articles)
```

```python
from telepot.namedtuple import InlineQueryResultPhoto

photos = [{'type': 'photo',
              'id': '123', 'photo_url': '...', 'thumb_url': '...'},
          InlineQueryResultPhoto(
              id='999', photo_url='...', thumb_url='...')]

bot.answerInlineQuery(query_id, photos)
```

#### Detect which answer has been chosen

By sending `/setinlinefeedback` to BotFather, you enable the bot to know which of the provided results your users have chosen. After `/setinlinefeedback` is done, your bot will receive one more flavor of messages: `chosen_inline_result`.

```python
flavor = telepot.flavor(msg)

if flavor == 'normal':
   ...
elif flavor == 'inline_query':
   ...
elif flavor == 'chosen_inline_result':
   ...
```

A chosen inline result has this structure:

```python
{u'from': {u'first_name': u'Nick', u'id': 999999999},
 u'query': u'qqqqq',
 u'result_id': u'abc'}
 ```

The `result_id` refers to the id you have assigned to a particular answer.

Again, use `glance()` to extract "headline" info:

```python
result_id, from_id, query_string = telepot.glance(msg, flavor='chosen_inline_result')
```

#### A skeleton that deals with all flavors

```python
import sys
import time
import telepot

def handle(msg):
    flavor = telepot.flavor(msg)

    # normal message
    if flavor == 'normal':
        content_type, chat_type, chat_id = telepot.glance(msg)
        print 'Normal Message:', content_type, chat_type, chat_id

        # Do your stuff according to `content_type` ...

    # inline query - need `/setinline`
    elif flavor == 'inline_query':
        query_id, from_id, query_string = telepot.glance(msg, flavor=flavor)
        print 'Inline Query:', query_id, from_id, query_string

        # Compose your own answers
        articles = [{'type': 'article',
                        'id': 'abc', 'title': 'ABC', 'message_text': 'Good morning'}]

        bot.answerInlineQuery(query_id, articles)

    # chosen inline result - need `/setinlinefeedback`
    elif flavor == 'chosen_inline_result':
        result_id, from_id, query_string = telepot.glance(msg, flavor=flavor)
        print 'Chosen Inline Result:', result_id, from_id, query_string

        # Remember the chosen answer to do better next time

    else:
        raise telepot.BadFlavor(msg)


TOKEN = sys.argv[1]  # get token from command-line

bot = telepot.Bot(TOKEN)
bot.notifyOnMessage(handle)
print 'Listening ...'

# Keep the program running.
while 1:
    time.sleep(10)
```

However, dealing with inline queries this way is not ideal. As you types and pauses, types and pauses, types and pauses ... closely bunched inline queries arrive. In fact, a new inline query often arrives *before* we finish processing a preceding one. With only a single thread of execution, we can only process the (closely bunched) inline queries sequentially. Ideally, whenever we see a new inline query from the same user, it should override and cancel any preceding inline queries being processed (that belong to the same user).

Telepot has a ready-made solution for you ...

<a id="inline-query-answerer"></a>
#### Use `Answerer` to answer inline queries

An `Answerer` takes an inline query, inspects its `from` `id` (the originating user id), and checks to see whether that user has an *unfinished* thread processing a preceding inline query. If there is, the unfinished thread will be cancelled before a new thread is spawned to process the latest inline query. In other words, an `Answerer` ensures **at most one** active inline-query-processing thread per user.

`Answerer` also frees you from having to call `bot.answerInlineQuery()` every time. You supply it with an *answer-computing function*. It takes that function's returned value and calls `bot.answerInlineQuery()` to send the results. Being accessible by multiple threads, the answer-computing function must be **thread-safe**.

To use an `Answerer`, you construct it with an answer-computing function:

```python
def compute_answer(inline_query):
    articles = [{'type': 'article',
                     'id': 'abc', 'title': 'ABC', 'message_text': 'XYZ'}]
    return articles

answerer = telepot.helper.Answerer(bot, compute_answer)
```

Then, you dump inline queries to it. It will ensure at most one active thread per user.

```python
flavor = telepot.flavor(msg)

if flavor == 'inline_query':
    answerer.answer(msg)
```

If you use telepot's [async version](#async) (Python 3.4.3 or newer), you should also use the async version of `Answerer`. In that case, it will create *tasks* instead of spawning threads, and you don't have to worry about thread safety. 

`Answerer` may be used in a global context (as above), or within an [Inline User Handler](#inline-only). For a full demonstration of its usage, please see the [examples](#examples-answerer-usage).

**[Read the reference Â»](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot/blob/master/REFERENCE.md)**

<a id="classbased"></a>
## Class-based Message Handling

Defining a global message handler may lead to proliferation of global variables quickly. Encapsulation may be achieved by extending the `Bot` class, defining a `handle` method, then calling `notifyOnMessage()` with no callback function. This way, the object's `handle` method will be used as the callback.

Here is a Python 3 skeleton using this strategy. Remember that you may not need the blocks dealing with `inline_query` and `chosen_inline_result` if you have not `/setinline` or `/setinlinefeedback` on the bot.

```python
import sys
import time
import telepot

class YourBot(telepot.Bot):
    def handle(self, msg):
        flavor = telepot.flavor(msg)

        # normal message
        if flavor == 'normal':
            content_type, chat_type, chat_id = telepot.glance(msg)
            print('Normal Message:', content_type, chat_type, chat_id)

            # Do your stuff according to `content_type` ...

        # inline query - need `/setinline`
        elif flavor == 'inline_query':
            query_id, from_id, query_string = telepot.glance(msg, flavor=flavor)
            print('Inline Query:', query_id, from_id, query_string)

            # Compose your own answers
            articles = [{'type': 'article',
                            'id': 'abc', 'title': 'ABC', 'message_text': 'Good morning'}]

            bot.answerInlineQuery(query_id, articles)

        # chosen inline result - need `/setinlinefeedback`
        elif flavor == 'chosen_inline_result':
            result_id, from_id, query_string = telepot.glance(msg, flavor=flavor)
            print('Chosen Inline Result:', result_id, from_id, query_string)

            # Remember the chosen answer to do better next time

        else:
            raise telepot.BadFlavor(msg)


TOKEN = sys.argv[1]  # get token from command-line

bot = YourBot(TOKEN)
bot.notifyOnMessage()
print('Listening ...')

# Keep the program running.
while 1:
    time.sleep(10)
```

<a id="threads-conversation"></a>
## Maintain Threads of Conversation

Having a single message handler is adequate for simple programs. For more sophisticated programs where states need to be maintained across messages, a better approach is needed.

Consider this scenario. A bot wants to have an intelligent conversation with a lot of users, and if we could only use a single message-handling function, we would have to maintain some state variables about each conversation *outside* the function. On receiving each message, we first have to check whether the user already has a conversation started, and if so, what we have been talking about. To avoid such mundaneness, we need a structured way to maintain "threads" of conversation.

Let's look at my solution. Here, I implemented a bot that counts how many messages have been sent by an individual user. If no message is received after 10 seconds, it starts over (timeout). The counting is done *per chat* - that's the important point.

```python
import sys
import telepot
from telepot.delegate import per_chat_id, create_open

class MessageCounter(telepot.helper.ChatHandler):
    def __init__(self, seed_tuple, timeout):
        super(MessageCounter, self).__init__(seed_tuple, timeout)
        self._count = 0

    def on_message(self, msg):
        self._count += 1
        self.sender.sendMessage(self._count)

TOKEN = sys.argv[1]  # get token from command-line

bot = telepot.DelegatorBot(TOKEN, [
    (per_chat_id(), create_open(MessageCounter, timeout=10)),
])
bot.notifyOnMessage(run_forever=True)
```

A `DelegatorBot` is a `Bot` with the newfound ability to spawn *delegates*. Its constructor takes a list of tuples telling it when and how to spawn delegates. In the example above, it is spawning one `MessageCounter` *per chat id*.

For every received message, the function `per_chat_id()` digests it down to a *seed* - in this case, the chat id. At first, when there is no `MessageCounter` associated with a seed (chat id), a new `MessageCounter` is created. Next time, when there is already a `MessageCounter` associated with the seed (chat id), no new one is needed.

A `MessageCounter` is only an object encapsulating states; it says nothing about how to spawn a delegate. The function `create_open()` causes the spawning of a thread. Thread is the default delegation mechanism (that is why I use the verb "spawn"). There is a way to provide your own implementation of threads or other delegation mechanisms. The [Chatbox example](#examples-chatbox) demonstrates this possibility.

The function `create_open()` requires the object `MessageCounter` to meet certain criteria. Being a subclass of `ChatHandler`, `MessageCounter` fulfills most of them. The only thing it has to do is implement the method `on_message()`, which is called whenever a normal message arrives. How messages are distributed to the correct object is done by telepot. You don't have to worry about that.

<a id="follow-user"></a>
## Follow User's Every Action

The Message Counter example only deals with normal messages. What if you want to maintain states across different flavors of messages? Here is a tracker that follows all messages originating from a user, regardless of flavor.

```python
import sys
import telepot
from telepot.delegate import per_from_id, create_open

class UserTracker(telepot.helper.UserHandler):
    def __init__(self, seed_tuple, timeout):
        super(UserTracker, self).__init__(seed_tuple, timeout)

        # keep track of how many messages of each flavor
        self._counts = {'normal': 0,
                        'inline_query': 0,
                        'chosen_inline_result': 0}

    def on_message(self, msg):
        flavor = telepot.flavor(msg)
        self._counts[flavor] += 1

        print(self.id, ':', self._counts)

        # Have to answer inline query to receive chosen result
        if flavor == 'inline_query':
            query_id, from_id, query_string = telepot.glance(msg, flavor=flavor)

            articles = [{'type': 'article',
                             'id': 'abc', 'title': 'ABC', 'message_text': 'Good morning'}]

            self.bot.answerInlineQuery(query_id, articles)


TOKEN = sys.argv[1]

bot = telepot.DelegatorBot(TOKEN, [
    (per_from_id(), create_open(UserTracker, timeout=20)),
])
bot.notifyOnMessage(run_forever=True)
```

All messages, regardless of flavor, as long as it is originating from a user, would have a `from` field containing an `id`. The function `per_from_id()` digests a message down to its originating user id, thus ensuring there is one and only one `UserTracker` *per user id*.

`UserTracker`, being a subclass of `UserHandler`, is automatically set up to capture messages originating from a certain user, regardless of flavor.

`per_from_id()` and `UserHandler` combined, we can track a user's every step.

<a id="inline-only"></a>
## Inline-only Handler

What if you only care about inline query (and chosen inline result)? Well, here you go ...

```python
import sys
import telepot
from telepot.delegate import per_inline_from_id, create_open

class InlineHandler(telepot.helper.UserHandler):
    def __init__(self, seed_tuple, timeout):
        super(InlineHandler, self).__init__(seed_tuple, timeout, flavors=['inline_query', 'chosen_inline_result'])

    def on_message(self, msg):
        flavor = telepot.flavor(msg)

        if flavor == 'inline_query':
            query_id, from_id, query_string = telepot.glance(msg, flavor=flavor)
            print(self.id, ':', 'Inline Query:', query_id, from_id, query_string)

            articles = [{'type': 'article',
                             'id': 'abc', 'title': 'ABC', 'message_text': 'Good morning'}]

            self.bot.answerInlineQuery(query_id, articles)
            print(self.id, ':', 'Answers sent.')

        elif flavor == 'chosen_inline_result':
            result_id, from_id, query_string = telepot.glance(msg, flavor=flavor)
            print(self.id, ':', 'Chosen Inline Result:', result_id, from_id, query_string)


TOKEN = sys.argv[1]

bot = telepot.DelegatorBot(TOKEN, [
    (per_inline_from_id(), create_open(InlineHandler, timeout=10)),
])
bot.notifyOnMessage(run_forever=True)
```

The function `per_inline_from_id()` digests a message down to its originating user id, but only for **inline query** and **chosen inline result**. It ignores normal messages.

`InlineHandler`, again, is a subclass of `UserHandler`. But it specifies which message flavors to capture (in the constructor). In this case, it only cares about **inline query** and **chosen inline result**.

This inline bot does the job, but not ideally. As the user types and pauses, types and pauses, types and pauses ... closely bunched inline queries arrive. In fact, a new inline query often arrives *before* we finish processing a preceding one. With only a single thread of execution *per user id*, we can only process the (closely bunched) inline queries sequentially. Ideally, whenever we see a new inline query from the same user, it should override and cancel any preceding inline queries being processed (that belong to the same user).

[As mentioned earlier](#inline-query-answerer), a solution is to use `Answerer`. It inspects an inline query's `from` `id` (the originating user id), cancels any unfinished thread of the same user, and ensures **at most one** active inline-query-processing thread per user.

For a full demonstration of `Answerer`'s uage, please see the [examples](#examples-answerer-usage).

<a id="async"></a>
## Async Version (Python 3.4.3 or newer)

Everything discussed so far assumes traditional Python. That is, network operations are blocking; if you want to serve many users at the same time, some kind of threads are usually needed. Another option is to use an asynchronous or event-driven framework, such as [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/).

Python 3.4 introduces its own asynchronous architecture, the `asyncio` module. Telepot supports that, too. If your bot is to serve many people, I strongly recommend doing it asynchronously. Threads, in my opinion, is a thing of yesteryears.

Raspbian does not come with Python 3.4. You have to compile it yourself.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev openssl libreadline-dev
$ cd ~
$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/Python-3.4.3.tgz
$ tar zxf Python-3.4.3.tgz
$ cd Python-3.4.3
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Finally:

```
$ sudo pip3.4 install telepot
```

In case you are not familiar with asynchronous programming, let's start by learning about generators and coroutines:

- ['yield' and Generators Explained](https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/)
- [Sequences and Coroutines](http://wla.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa11/lectures/streams.html)

... why we want asynchronous programming:

- [Problem: Threads Are Bad](https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html)

... how generators and coroutines are applied to asynchronous programming:

- [Understanding Asynchronous IO](http://sahandsaba.com/understanding-asyncio-node-js-python-3-4.html)
- [What are the main uses of `yield from`?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9708902/in-practice-what-are-the-main-uses-for-the-new-yield-from-syntax-in-python-3)
- [A Curious Course on Coroutines and Concurrency](http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/)

... and how an asyncio program is generally structured:

- [The New asyncio Module in Python 3.4](http://www.drdobbs.com/open-source/the-new-asyncio-module-in-python-34-even/240168401)
- [Event loop examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#event-loop-examples)
- [HTTP server and client](http://aiohttp.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)

#### Very similar to the traditional, but different

The async version of `Bot`, `SpeakerBot`, and `DelegatorBot` basically mirror the traditional version's. Main differences are:
- blocking methods (e.g. `sendMessage()`) are now coroutines, and should be called with `yield from`
- delegation is achieved by coroutine and task

Because of that (and this is true of asynchronous Python in general), a lot of methods will not work in the interactive Python interpreter like regular functions would. They will have to be driven by an event loop.

#### Skeleton, by extending the basic `Bot`

```python
import sys
import asyncio
import telepot
import telepot.async

class YourBot(telepot.async.Bot):
    @asyncio.coroutine
    def handle(self, msg):
        # ......

TOKEN = sys.argv[1]  # get token from command-line

bot = YourBot(TOKEN)
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

loop.create_task(bot.messageLoop())
print('Listening ...')

loop.run_forever()
```

**[View source Â»](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot/blob/master/examples/skeletona_extend.py)**

#### Skeleton, by defining a global handler

```python
import sys
import asyncio
import telepot
import telepot.async

@asyncio.coroutine
def handle(msg):
    # ......

TOKEN = sys.argv[1]  # get token from command-line

bot = telepot.async.Bot(TOKEN)
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

loop.create_task(bot.messageLoop(handle))
print('Listening ...')

loop.run_forever()
```

**[View source Â»](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot/blob/master/examples/skeletona.py)**

#### Skeleton for `DelegatorBot`

I have re-done the `MessageCounter` example here. Again, it is very similar to the [traditional version](#threads-conversation).

```python
import sys
import asyncio
import telepot
from telepot.delegate import per_chat_id
from telepot.async.delegate import create_open

class MessageCounter(telepot.helper.ChatHandler):
    def __init__(self, seed_tuple, timeout):
        super(MessageCounter, self).__init__(seed_tuple, timeout)
        self._count = 0

    @asyncio.coroutine
    def on_message(self, msg):
        self._count += 1
        yield from self.sender.sendMessage(self._count)

TOKEN = sys.argv[1]  # get token from command-line

bot = telepot.async.DelegatorBot(TOKEN, [
    (per_chat_id(), create_open(MessageCounter, timeout=10)),
])

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.create_task(bot.messageLoop())
print('Listening ...')

loop.run_forever()
```

<a id="webhook"></a>
## Webhook Interface

So far, we have been using `getUpdates()` to obtain new messages from Telegram servers - both `notifyOnMessage()` and `messageLoop()` call `getUpdates()` constantly under the hood. Another way to obtain new messages is through **[webhooks](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#setwebhook)**, in which case Telegram servers will send an HTTPS POST request to an URL you specify, containing a JSON-serialized [Update](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#update) object, whenever there is an update for the bot.

Setting up a webhook is more complicated than using `getUpdates()` because:

1. You have to obtain an URL
2. You have to obtain and set up an SSL certificate for the URL
3. You have to set up a web server to handle the POST requests coming from Telegram servers

For a simple bot application, it is easy to use telepot directly from the web application. To make a smarter bot where you want to leverage telepot's more advanced features (e.g. to maintain separate "threads" of conversation using `DelegatorBot` and `ChatHandler`), we need a structured way to bring the web application and telepot together.

Webhook also presents a subtle problem: closely bunched updates may arrive out of order. That is, update_id `1000` may arrive ahead of update_id `999`, if the two are issued by Telegram servers very closely. Unless a bot absolutely doesn't care about update order, it will have to re-order them in some way.

*Since 5.0*, telepot has a mechanism for web applications to interface with easily, and it takes care of re-ordering for you. The mechanism is simple: you call `notifyOnMessage()` or `messageLoop()` to initiate the bot's message handling as usual, but with an additional parameter `source`, which is a queue. 

```python
# for Python 2 and 3
try:
    from Queue import Queue
except ImportError:
    from queue import Queue

def handle(msg):
    # ......

bot = telepot.Bot(TOKEN)
update_queue = Queue()

# get updates from queue, not from Telegram servers
bot.notifyOnMessage(handle, source=update_queue)
```

The web application, upon receiving a POST request, dumps the data onto the queue, for the bot to retrieve at the other end. The bot will re-order the updates if necessary. Assuming [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as the web application framework:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook_path', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def pass_update():
    update_queue.put(request.data)  # dump data to queue
    return 'OK'
```

It is beyond the scope of this document to detail the usage of web frameworks. Please look at the **[webhook examples](#examples-webhooks)** for full demonstrations. Remember, you will have to set up the webhook URL, SSL certificate, and web server on your own.

<a id="deep-linking"></a>
## Deep Linking

Telegram website's introduction to [deep linking](https://core.telegram.org/bots#deep-linking) may be a bit confusing to beginners. I try to give a clearer explanation here.

1. You have a database of users. Each user has an ID. Suppose you want your Telegram bot to communicate with user `123`, but you don't know his Telegram `chat_id` (which the bot needs in order to send messages to him). How do you "entice" him to talk to the bot, thus revealing his `chat_id`? You put a link on a web page.

2. But the link has to be "personalized". You want each user to press on a slightly different link, in order to distinguish them. One way to do that is to embed user ID in the link. However, user IDs are *not* something you want to expose, so you generate a (temporary) **key** associated with a user ID, and **embed that key in the link**. If user `123` has the key `abcde`, his personalized link will be:

    ```
    https://telegram.me/<bot_username>?start=abcde
    ```

3. Someone clicks on the link, and is led to a conversation with your bot. When he presses the START button, your bot will receive a message:

    ```
    /start abcde
    ```

4. On receiving that message, the bot sees that `abcde` is associated with user `123`. Telegram `chat_id` can also be extracted from the message. Knowing user `123`'s `chat_id`, the bot can send him messages afterwards.

2. The bot randomly picks an integer between 0-99.
3. You make a guess.
4. The bot tells you to go higher or lower.
5. Repeat step 3 and 4, until guess is correct.

This example is able to serve many players at once. It illustrates the usage of `DelegateBot` and `ChatHandler`.

#### Chatbox - a Mailbox for Chats

1. People send messages to your bot.
2. Your bot remembers the messages.
3. You read the messages later.

It accepts the following commands from you, the owner, only:

- `/unread` - tells you who has sent you messages and how many
- `/next` - read next sender's messages

This example can be a starting point for **customer support** type of bot accounts. For example, customers send questions to a bot account; staff answers the questions behind the scene, makes it look like the bot is answering questions.

It further illustrates the use of `DelegateBot` and `ChatHandler`, and how to spawn delegates differently according to the role of users.

This example only handles text messages and stores messages in memory. If the bot is killed, all messages are lost. It is an *example* after all.

#### Deep Linking

Using Flask as the web frontend, this example serves a web link at `<base_url>/link`, and sets up a webhook at `<base_url>/abc`

- Open browser, visit: `<base_url>/link`
- Click on the link
- On Telegram conversation, click on the START button
- Bot should receive a message: `/start ghijk`, where `ghijk` is the key embedded in the link, and the payload sent along with the `/start` command. You may use this key to identify the user, then his Telegram `chat_id`.
